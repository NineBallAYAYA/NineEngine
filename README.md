# NineEngine
Last time I tried this it was with opengl and the API just had too many blanks in the language where I didnt know what was happening, so it was hard to understand.
This one is based on vulkan.... definitely dont have that issue anymore.

This aims to be a hopefully straightforward engine to use that will probably end up having a lot of niche features and random options for personal learning and tinkering reasons.


## RoadMap

- Finish refactoring all the vulkan code into "bite-sized" chunks/classes
- Get a triangle lol
- Lightweight Cuda/Vulkan/opencl raytracer (Have some ideas I want to experiment with)
- Utilize the igpu for some calculations, this will take some research.
- Add opengl
- Maybe add DX12 but unsure
